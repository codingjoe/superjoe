description: Orchestration for joe's agent crew.

SuperJoe = a crew. Use it as an **iterative loop**, not a one-shot dispatch. The main thread runs the loop; agents do one step each.

## The loop

Run in order. Restart at step 1 whenever a later step fails.

1. **Build** — `builderJoe` produces minimal, working code.
1. **Simplify** — `lazyJoe` flags over-engineering and bloat. Cut it, or route back to `builderJoe`.
1. **Document** — `docuJoe` documents the public surface.
1. **Test** — `testJoe` covers every branch, 100%, no unreachable code.
1. **Review** — `inspectorJoe` lists issues with location + one-line reason. Fix each, then re-run.
1. **Harden** — `secretJoe` hunts vulnerabilities. Fix or route to `builderJoe`.

Spawn `researchJoe` from any step when a dependency or fact needs checking; it never edits.

## Exit gates

Ship only when ALL pass:

- `inspectorJoe` reports zero issues
- `testJoe` reports 100% coverage
- `secretJoe` finds nothing exploitable

Any gate failing sends the work back to the step that owns it. Keep looping until all three are green.

## Modes

The crew simplifies at one of three levels. Default: **full**. The user sets it ("ultra", "lite mode"); pass it to `builderJoe` and `lazyJoe` in every prompt.

| Mode  | builderJoe                                                                      | lazyJoe                                                       |
| ----- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------- |
| lite  | Builds what's asked; names the lazier alternative in one line.                  | Flags only clear rung violations.                             |
| full  | The ladder enforced: YAGNI -> reuse -> stdlib -> native -> one line -> minimum. | Flags every rung violation.                                   |
| ultra | YAGNI extremist: deletion before addition; challenges the requirement itself.   | Flags speculative anything, including tests beyond one check. |

## One-shot reports

Outside the loop, on request:

- `joe-audit` — whole-repo over-engineering audit, ranked list of what to delete.
- `joe-debt` — harvest `joe:` shortcut comments into a tracked ledger.

## Prompting agents

Prompt = work reference + user story or QED + explicit user instructions for the task. Nothing else. No task lists, no step-by-step, no output contracts.

Include what grounds the agent:

- Minimal file refs: `src/auth.ts`
- Prior review: `see review on PR #12` or `see <branch> diff: git diff main...branch`
- Goal: one user story sentence, exception message or expected behaviour (bugs only)
- Steps: QED, short, numbered bullets to reproduce the error
- Explicit user instructions for the task, verbatim.

Prompt shape:

```text
Work: <file(s)> or <PR/branch diff reference>
Goal: As a <role>, I want <capability>, so that <benefit>.
User said: <explicit instruction, verbatim>
```

or

```text
Work: <file(s)> or <PR/branch diff reference>
Goal: Should return boolean
Steps: 1. click this 2. click that 3. boom! QED
User said: <explicit instruction, verbatim>
```
